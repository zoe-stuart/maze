#Triwizard Maze

##Background:
Welcome to the Triwizard maze! This is the last event in the Triwizard Tournament, and winning will bring you fame and glory.

##Game Play:
Playing the game is easy. Follow instructions on the screen to choose a player and to begin, then use the arrow keys to navigate around the maze, collecting goblets. Exiting in the top left will teleport you to the bottom right exit, and vice versa.
You only have 30 seconds to collect all of the goblets and exit the maze in the bottom left, but each goblet you collect will add 5 seconds to your time.

##Good luck!!
